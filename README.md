I am a full-stack web developer, electronic engineer and indie musician.

For more than 10 years I was working and studying for Oil & Gas industry, but now I'm redirecting to the technological world. I see a lot of opportunities to boost my career to the next level as a software developer and, that's why I've been training about the most nowadays used technologies for web applications.

Skills: Javascript | Typescript | React JS | Express JS, among others

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve just finished a hotel management application as part of the final project of full stack development bootcamp. I was working with a 10 members group through scrum methodology. The project was developed in TS, Ant design as style components and supabase.io as backend-database service provider.

- I'm starting to build an application for a start-up that plan to provide legal and technical advisory services for real state sector.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about supabase.io, ant design, UI/UX, among others
